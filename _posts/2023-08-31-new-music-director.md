## New Music Director – Mark Madsen

I will be taking over as the Music Director for the 11am Mass at St. Joseph's College.

I was previously the Music Director at St. Joseph's College 20 years ago, and I am excited to be back.

I've put together a list of music that I am familiar with and that I think will work well at the 11am Mass.
This is just a starting point, and as I get up to speed I will be adding more music to the list and taking suggestions.
