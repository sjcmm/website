## Mass Setting

We will be moving over to a new Mass Setting: **Mass of Renewal** by _Curtis Stephan_.

Many of you may already know Mass of Renewal as it is used in many other parishes in the Edmonton Archdiocese.
It is easy to learn and sing, and we hope that you will join us in singing it.

You can find the Mass Setting in Glory & Praise 3 (G&P3).

- **Kyrie Eleison – 92 (G&P3)**
- **Gloria – 93 (G&P3)**
- **Gospel Acclamation – 94 (G&P3)**
- **Holy – 96 (G&P3)**
- **Amen – 100 (G&P3)**
- **Lamb of God – 101 (G&P3)**
